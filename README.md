Selected programs from operating systems class. Note that these are school assignments, and most formatting and functionality decisions were mandated.

"Adventure" is the start of a text-based game akin to Colossal Cave Adventure. The assignment was intended to teach creating, writing to, and reading from different files and directories. As such, it was mandated that each "Room" in the game be represented as an individual file. The player navigates between rooms until they reach the randomly selected victory location. The game keeps track of the player's path path, and issues errors if the player attempts to visit a room that does not exist.

"Smallsh" is a simple shell program, to teach forking child processes, listening for interrupts, running programs in the foreground and background, and dealing with zombies. 

The several "OTP" files, and "keygen", cumulatively create a one-time pad encryption program, to demonstrate socket programming. The files suffixed with "_d" are daemons that run in the background. When given a plaintext file and randomly generated cipher, otp_enc and otp_dec encode and decode (respectively) the text.
